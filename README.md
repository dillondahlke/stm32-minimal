# stm32-minimal
A minimal firmware build for the STM32 Nucleo F446RE development board

This project was created by learning from [cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide](https://github.com/cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide)

In this project, I use the ideas learned from [cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide](https://github.com/cpq/bare-metal-programming-guide)
to create a minimal bootable firmware for a slightly different STM32 microcontroller.
